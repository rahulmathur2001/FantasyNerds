                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Invincible, for the unaware, was an Image Comics series that ran from 2003 up until the final issue in 2018. Created by Robert Kirkman, in his pre-The Walking Dead media empire days, and Cory Walker, the series follows Mark Grayson, the titular Invincible, as he follows in his father’s footsteps as a superhero while juggling the challenges of being a teenager in high school. The series is a surprisingly close adaptation to these early issues and manages to capture the energy and world that made Invincible such a success back when it first launched</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">The bulk of the premiere is spent focusing on Mark (Steven Yeun) and his relationship with his parents. Nolan (JK Simmons) and Debbie (Sandra Oh) are loving and supportive parents whose marriage manages to be wholesome and very much alive even as Nolan juggles his personal life with his role as the incredibly powerful Omni-Man. These scenes are genuinely powerful and easily the most humanistic, natural writing I’ve seen from Kirkman, who wrote the premiere’s script</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">A particular stand-out for me is the scene where Debbie confronts Mark over his obsessive training. A mother suddenly having to deal with a frustrated, angry son who can throw the family SUV into low orbit is a terrifying prospect, but Sandra Oh’s performance gives a quiet dignity and power to Debbie as she outright confronts Mark’s burgeoning toxic masculinity. Forcing Mark to face the attitude he is developing by asking “Does that make you feel strong? To know, I can’t physically make you do something? Is that what you need?” is a powerful moment and keeps the very much human Debbie a relevant, compelling character in a world filled with super-powered heroes and villains.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Speaking of those super-powered folks, the showcase of those abilities is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Animated by South Korean studio Maven Image Platform, Invincible is a stunning show. Every fight scene is smooth and weighty. Inventive uses of old stand-by superpowers like super-speed and strength make big-budget live-action superhero projects look stiff and quaint in comparison. This is helped by the design work put in by Cory Walker, who serves as the show’s lead character designer. The scenes are filled with bright, eye-catching hero costumes to make even the most crowded of fight scenes easy to follow and enjoy. But fights aren’t the only visual delight Invincible has up its sleeve.</p>

                    <!-- <h2>Lord Of The Rings:Trilogy Review</h2> -->

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">My favorite part of the entire premiere came when Mark Grayson first suits up as Invincible. Rather than a climactic shot to end the episode, we are treated to an extended sequence of Invincible trying out his powers by soaring through a crowded metropolis. Set to “Broken Boy” by Cage the Elephant, the entire scene is just an absolute joy to behold. Mark’s excited whoops as he speeds between skyscrapers are infectious. The fluid combination of slick 2D animation with 3D backgrounds outshines many theatrical releases who tried the same trick (looking at you, Dragon Ball Super: Broly). Segueing beautifully into Invincible’s first big superhero fight, the entire triumphant sequence ends the episode with a charming, just-clever-enough title card drop that solidifies the series’ playful tone.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Invincible, the comic, became infamous over its 144-issue run for its gore-filled fight scenes. Blood-drenched pages that featured disembowelments, decapitations, and every possible permutation between the two in often gratuitous detail became a hallmark of the series. That all started with the reveal in Invincible #7 that Omni-Man is not the hero he pretends to be. Murdering his way through the Guardians of the Globe, a knock-off Justice League, he is revealed as an alien conqueror waiting to take the Earth as his prize. The specter of this ultra-violent streak hung over the premiere the entire time I watched, and, disappointingly, it appeared in the episode’s final scene.</p>
