                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">As Brandon Sanderson predicted in 2018’s State of the Sanderson update, the author dedicated most of 2019 to working on book 4 in The Stormlight Archive.

                        And it paid off: as Tor Books announced last week, The Stormlight Archive’s fourth volume will be released on November 17, 2020. That’s the big news from 2019’s “State of the Sanderson” update, where the author gives his readers an update on all the various projects he’s undertaken, but there’s also some news about the Mistborn series, along with a giant status update on the future of the Cosmere itself.
                        
                        Read on for key tidbits!</p>  
                      <p style="color: white;">Stormlight Archive Book 5 For 2023 With Stormlight Four nearing its wrap-up point wrapped up, Sanderson notes that “we’ll have only one more book in the first Stormlight sequence.” But it’s going to be a while before readers get Book Five in their hands. The author said he plans to begin writing Stormlight volume 5 in 2022 for a 2023 release, noting that “a three-year gap is best for my writing psychology.”</p>  
                      <p style="color: white;">And a Stormlight Archive Picture Book For 2020?
    
                        Sanderson mentions that there are currently efforts for a picture book adaptation of “the girl who looked up” story that Shallan and Wit tell in Oathbringer. If this works out, the author says it could be released around the same time as Stormlight Book Four, in late 2020.</p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">One of the legendary as well as Classic fantasy story is going to be  Amazon WebSeries</p> 
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Robert Jordan’s beloved high fantasy series The Wheel of Time is coming to the screen. Finally. The first book, The Eye of the World, arrived on shelves in 1990. And now, decades later, Amazon Prime Video is bringing the world of Rand al’Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara and so many more to life. It’s a rich story, dense with lore, magic, and about a million characters. The Wheel of Time series contains 14 novels, with Brandon Sanderson completing the last three books after Jordan’s passing. Adapting that much story is a challenge, and a TV series seems like the best way to approach it.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">We know season one has eight episodes, but we don’t know how much story those eight episodes will cover. It’s possible they’ll cover roughly one book per season. Or more likely that they’ll bring in elements from different books as the adaptation dictates. That would be a more flexible way to tell the story. We’ll certainly update you when we have concrete information about this.</p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">The Witcher season 2 has a release date of December 17, 2021! WitcherCon brought us the official announcement – after such a long wait, fans will no doubt be delighted to see Geralt of Rivia, Ciri and Yennefer again. You can also see the full trailer below, which was released at the same event.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">Aside from the release date and trailer, what else is there to know about The Witcher season 2? We've been able to draw a few conclusions based on interviews with the show's creators, as well as the source material of author Andrzej Sapkowski, and we also know who the full cast is for the next set of episodes. On this page, you'll find everything we know about it so far.</p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Amazon is planing to revive the lord of rings saga with a prequal to the Rohirrim </p> 
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">While Amazon has become an Emmys juggernaut with more intimate series like “Fleabag” and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” those kind of character-based stories are not all the streaming service does – or plans to do. And no upcoming series proves that point more than Amazon’s long-awaited, multi-season television adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.”</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Since it was originally announced in 2017, news about the show has come in fits and starts. In recent months, 20 new cast members had joined the project, and a synopsis of the series was reported by TheOneRing.net. In that synopsis, it confirms that locations that will be included in the series are Númenor, the Misty Mountains, and the elf-capital of Lindon. The story will take place in Tolkien’s Second Age era, millennia before the events of “The Hobbit.”</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">And while there’s still no trailer or concrete release date for the show, but a handful of other noteworthy details about the series have been released since its announcement. Perhaps the most startling? That the total price tag for the first season of the show is estimated to come in at $450 million. (By comparison, a season of “Game of Thrones” was estimated to cost $90 million, or about $15 million an episode.) According to New Zealand publication Stuff, the amount was ascertained by the NZ$160 million tax credit the production will receive for filming in the country. To receive a tax credit of that amount, the budget is estimated to come in at just shy of half a billion American dollars.</p>
