                </div>
                <div class="col-md-9 text-center">
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">The Amazon superhero series The Boys is based on a comic book series of the same name. Some things were changed in the comic-to-screen adaptation.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">Stormfront - Comics After the success of their adaptation of Garth Ennis’ Preacher, showrunners Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg return to adapt another of the writer’s best-known works: The Boys. Originally created by Ennis and Darick Robertson, The Boys turned the superhero genre on its head by depicting costumed crime-fighters as dangerously narcissistic celebrities with godlike powers. That’s where The Boys come in. When a hero gets out of line, Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his crew “spank the bastards” back in line.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">In the comics, Stormfront doesn't have the relationship with Homelander or the storyline she does in the show.  Though her origin is somewhat similar, with her true past and identity being hidden from the public, her ultimate fate at the hands of Ryan is far different.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">Another major change in the show from the comics is how it develops Ryan, the son of Homelander. Ryan doesn't exist at all in the comics, his life snuffed out in a violent rage by Billy The Butcher soon after birth. In the show, he develops quickly into a powerful young boy with shocking potential.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">His developing powers, specifically his eye lasers, lead to horrific consequences for Stormfront, whose ambitions exceed her grasp. It also leads to unexpected character developments for Homelander, who is far more complex in the show than he is in the original comic books.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">The true identity of Black Noir was a major mystery in the comics, teased over time until it was revealed that he was a clone of Homelander. This clone is a deranged murderer, behind some of the most shocking crimes in the comics. In the show, it seems that this isn't the case.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">The TV show has yet to completely reveal the identity of Black Noir, but context clues established in season two suggest he isn't a clone of Homelander. The biggest clue comes when he lifts his mask to eat a piece of candy. It appears that Black Noir is Black, and also severely scarred.</p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">Average readers might not notice what makes Watchmen so different. But superhero comic book covers tend to be superheroes striking poses fighting evil or supervillains striking poses fighting good, with a certain strategy to their art: According to the 2017 annotated version of Watchmen, because of the way comic books are displayed in an overlapping pattern in comic book stores, the trick is to push titles toward the center and keep the imagery to the center and right of the cover page. </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">The covers for all 12 issues of Watchmen — released just over 30 years ago, from 1986 to 1987 — balk at this. The title, written in all caps, traces up vertically on the left, near the spine. No characters appear on the covers, nor are there any fight scenes or scintillating imagery to lure the reader in, a break in ranks for superhero comic books. </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">No gimmicks, no tricks — no tradition. Watchmen hinted that it wouldn’t be anything like the superhero comics status quo before a reader even started leafing through an issue. </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">What happens in the book bears this out. Writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons begin with what seems like an everyday superhero story: a murder mystery, a band of heroes coming together, an all-powerful blue-skinned being, and humanity’s existence hanging in the balance.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">But slowly, Watchmen unfurls into something much darker and keener: a story that, while rife with ostentatious characters like mad genius Ozymandias and all-powerful Doctor Manhattan, is much more grounded in showing us what it’s like to be powerless. </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">We’ve heard over and over from other beloved comic book heroes that “with great power comes great responsibility.” Instead, Watchmen presents an uncomfortable scenario, a too-real reflection of how personal responsibility tends to evaporate in the presence of that great power. </p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">Would You like to read a fairytail which deal with some of more mature topic then Sweet Tooth is for you </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">The comic’s main narrative is compelling and easy to jump into. The comic’s mysteries are fascinating and become even more interesting as the narrative progresses. The characters are all wonderful and the character-development they experience is fantastic. The comic’s visuals look nice and pair perfectly with the storytelling.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">This is an incredibly unique and incredibly enjoyable comic book series. The comic takes readers on a wild ride that is solid at the start but only gets better as it progresses. Watching the mysteries unfold, watching the characters face their problems, and experiencing it all alongside beautiful visuals is simply great. Any reader can enjoy this series but it will particularly appeal to those who like deep mysteries and well-written characters</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">Sweet Tooth, by Jeff Lemire, is a weird, wild, and wonderful ride. The narrative hooks you in with drama and keeps you hooked through a series of deeper and deeper mysteries. This is a comic where every answer leads to new questions and these questions and answers become even more interesting as new ones arise. This captivating narrative also comes with an array of great characters. The characters are well written the whole way through and add a lot of emotion and drama into the mix. Together, these factors make for a reading experience that is easy to start and hard to stop</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4" style="color: white;">My only complaint is that the comic’s themes regarding humanity are just alright. Overall though, Sweet Tooth is a fantastic series for anyone, especially fans of mysteries and great characters.</p>
