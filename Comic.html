        <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center mx-3">Garth Ennis <span class="text-muted">Creator Of The Boys</span></h2>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Ennis began his comic-writing career in 1989 with the series Troubled Souls. Appearing in the short-lived but critically acclaimed British anthology Crisis and illustrated by John McCrea, it told the story of a young, apolitical Protestant man caught up by fate in the violence of the Irish 'Troubles'. It spawned a sequel, For a Few Troubles More, a broad Belfast-based comedy featuring two supporting characters from Troubled Souls, Dougie and Ivor, who would later get their own American comics series, Dicks, from Caliber in 1997, and several follow-ups from Avatar. Ennis was later critical of his writing debut, which he describes as "the kind of thing that was doing well at the time. (...) With hindsight, what Troubled Souls really represented was naked ambition. It was a direct attempt to get published. And that was the road that seemed most likely to lead me to success". </p>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Another series for Crisis was True Faith, a religious satire inspired by his schooldays, this time drawn by Warren Pleece. Like the two Troubles stories it was collected as a graphic novel in 1990, but religious protests led to it being quickly withdrawn from sale, apparently on the orders of publisher Robert Maxwell. It was later republished in 1997 by Vertigo. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center my-auto">Robert Kirkman <span class="text-muted">Creator of Invincible Comic's </span></h2>
        <p class="lead mx-3 text-center">Robert Kirkman's first comic book work was Battle Pope (2000), a superhero parody co-created with artist Tony Moore and self-published under the Funk-O-Tron label. Later, while pitching a new series, Science Dog, Kirkman and artist Cory Walker were hired to do a SuperPatriot miniseries for Image Comics. While working on that book, Kirkman and E.J. Su created the 2002 Image series Tech Jacket, which ran six issues.</p>
        <p class="lead mx-3 text-center">In 2003, Kirkman and Walker created Invincible for Image's new superhero line. The story surrounded the adolescent son of the world's most powerful superhero, who develops powers and starts his own superhero career. Walker later failed to meet the monthly title's deadlines and was replaced by Ryan Ottley. In 2005, Paramount Pictures announced it had bought the rights to produce an Invincible feature film, and hired Kirkman to write the screenplay.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center">Stan Lee <span class="text-muted">Co-Creator Of Many Of Marvel characters</span></h2>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">After graduating from high school at age 16, Lieber was hired as an editorial assistant for Timely Comics, and in 1942 he was promoted to editor. By that time he had begun writing comic-book scripts for Timely as Stan Lee, a pseudonym that eventually became his legal name. In the 1940s and ’50s—during which time the group, later named Atlas, struggled financially—Lee created several comic-book series, including The Witness, The Destroyer, Jack Frost, Whizzer, and Black Marvel.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">In 1961 Lee and artist Jack Kirby created The Fantastic Four, about four astronauts who gain superpowers after a cosmic incident. The series made him and Atlas—now known as Marvel—major forces in the comics world. One year later Lee and artist Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Lee, Kirby, and Ditko adopted a collaborative workflow that came to be known as “the Marvel method.” The technique gave artists significantly more input on story plotting, and it allowed Marvel to produce new content at a dizzying rate.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">The books joined a roster of increasingly successful series that also included The Incredible Hulk. Lee and Kirby added another winner to the group when they created The X-Men in 1963. A distinctive feature of Lee’s comic-book heroes is that they combine superhuman powers with human insecurities and emotions.</p>

          <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Jack Kirby, original name Jacob Kurtzberg, (born August 28, 1917, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 6, 1994, Thousand Oaks, California), American comic book artist who helped create hundreds of original characters, including Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, and the Fantastic Four.</p>
          <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Kirby left high school at age 16 and worked in Max Fleischer’s animation studio on Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons before teaming up with fellow artist Joe Simon in 1941. Working for Timely (later Marvel) Comics, the pair created Captain America, a star-spangled super-soldier who quickly became the publisher’s most popular character. Kirby and Simon collaborated on a number of titles over the following years, exploring the crime, horror, and humour genres, and they created the first romance comic in 1947. Kirby and Simon’s professional relationship was strained by the challenges of working in an increasingly competitive and uncertain market, and by 1956 the team had drifted apart. Kirby responded by turning to newspaper comic strips, and his Sky Masters of the Space Force was a moderate success.</p>
