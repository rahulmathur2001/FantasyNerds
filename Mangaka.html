        <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center mx-3">Eiichiro Oda <span class="text-muted">Writer Of One Piece</span></h2>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">A dedicated writer and artist since adolescence, Oda began working for Shueisha's Shonen Jump at 17 and currently stands as one of the world's most prominent mangaka, earning an estimated ¥3.1 billion (US$26 million) per year. Despite his rigorous work schedule, he maintains steady correspondence with fans (and the wider public) through both formal interviews and informal channels such as his SBS columns.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Like most mangaka, Oda typically uses outlandish caricatures to represent himself in printed works. The most common of these is a striped tropical fish, best known for "giving" all of Oda's weekly comments in Shonen Jump's table of contents; in more detailed depictions (such as the Color Walks' Monochrome Talk headers), this fish is usually given human ears and affixed atop a human body like a mask. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading text-center my-auto">Masashi Kishimoto <span class="text-muted">Writer Of Naruto</span></h2>
        <p class="lead mx-3 text-center">Masashi Kishimoto was born in the Okayama Prefecture, Japan on November 8, 1974 as the older identical twin of Seishi Kishimoto. During his childhood, Kishimoto showed interest in drawing characters from the anime shows he watched, such as Dr. Slump's Arale and Doraemon's titular protagonist. In elementary school, Kishimoto started watching the Kinnikuman and Dragon Ball anime alongside his brother</p>
        <p class="lead mx-3 text-center">During the following years, Kishimoto started idolising Dragon Ball's author Akira Toriyama, enjoying not only his series Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, but also Dragon Quest, a role-playing video game for which Toriyama was art designer. While he could not afford to buy Weekly Shōnen Jump where the Dragon Ball manga was published, he followed the series thanks to a friend from school who had subscribed to the magazine.</p>

        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Isayama was born on August 29, 1986 in Ōyama, Ōita, Japan. After graduating from Ōita Prefectural Hitarinkou High School, he matriculated in the cartoon design program of the cartoon arts department, Kyushu Designer Gakuin. After graduating, he moved to Tokyo and started drawing his manga works</p>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">In 2006, he applied for the Magazine Grand Prix, also known as MGP, that is promoted by Kodansha Ltd., and his work, Attack on Titan, was given the Fine Work award. Originally, he offered his work to the Weekly Shōnen Jump department at Shueisha, where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for Weekly Shōnen Jump. He declined and decided to take it to the Weekly Shōnen Magazine department at Kodansha Ltd. instead.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center mx-3">In 2008, he applied for the 80th Weekly Shōnen Magazine Freshman Manga Award, where his work, Heart Break One, was given the Special Encouragement Award. </p>

          <p class="lead text-center mx-3">Hiromi Arakawa (荒川 |弘美) was born in Tokachi, a sub-prefecture in the northernmost island of Japan, Hokkaido. Her family owned a dairy and potatoes farm and Hiromi was raised there along with several sisters. As a teen, she helped her parents at the farm chores and played on the fields. She said manga had always been among her hobbies and that she read and collected manga of all genres, but was partial to Weekly Shōnen Jump and Weekly Shōnen Sunday (a magazine to which Arakawa now has a contract, publishing the manga Silver Spoon). Kinnikuman was one of her favorite manga. As a child, Arakawa dreamt of discovering what was beyond the farms and looked up to the mangaka profession (manga writer) as being ideal, “light” and carefree. </p>
          <p class="lead text-center mx-3">She went to an agricultural high school and, as she graduated, agreed with her parents she would help them at the farm for 7 years and, in this meantime, would take regular oil painting lessons at town. As that period ended, she moved to Tokyo to pursue her dream of becoming a mangaka and swore to her parents she would only return home once she was able to make a living out of manga. Arakawa started working with manga making doujins with her friends, one of the most known being Shishi Juushin Enbu, a co-work with her friend Zhang Fei Long. Ideas from this fanzine would be later incorporated into the manga Hero Tales. </p>
