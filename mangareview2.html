                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">I must begin by saying that you should not be discouraged. At first glance, it can be difficult, but you only have to write 90 chapters perfectly tied together, with great characters and mystery to the world and titans, fantastic fights that actually serve a purpose with barely any talk no Jutsu moments, and perhaps the single most important thing in all of this, Sasha being alive</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">What you ought to do is write a timeskip. This is meant for the end-series so we can have a "where are they now" segment but there is no need to worry about that as another timeskip will occur in the last chapter and get the pleasure of seeing in efficiency how awful Eren's plan was. The first timeskip is primarily meant as a means of showing Eren becoming this evil incarnate that at no point in the series have we gotten hits about such alteration to his character. He's convinced all the lives must be taken in order to obtain "freedom" and in doing it he ought to go against his friends causing an artificial conflict between him and the rest of Paradis as well countless third parties in which for entirely redundant reasons will join Paradis side and go against Eren. From this point onwards, you don't have to write anything decent since it will all depend on which character is to your liking the most and you'll always have to make him or her achieve whatever goal they are in need of. In this case, it's Armin. He's mastered the talk no Jutsu, I dare to say it's his strongest technique. Anyone he's talked to has been convinced to help him do whatever he's wanted to and its limits know no bounds. The second timeskip is a reminder of how Yams got worse at writing a proper story without contrivance to the characters thus becoming the biggest clown in the history of clowns and retconning all he's build-up for so long. </p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">With the power of friendship, Armin doesn't give up, not for one moment while he and co-venture towards Eren to stop him but first, we must go a bit before all that because you are clearly asking how all those characters have joined the Paradis side. Because of plot device, they ultimately were there because Eren too changed side and there was no choice but to help their enemies. The two couldn't stay on one side only since that wouldn't make sense, just like it doesn't make any sense for Reiner, Pieck, and others to help Armin and Mikasa, meant solely as an excuse for "redemption" for some of the characters. Armin succeeds because of course, he did, Eren becomes dove because of course, he did, we never learn much about the titans and the few things we get to throw at us are pure nonsense in an asspull way upon the "paths" was introduced into the story which, for all intents and purposes is the main reason why the second arc of the timeskip is this bad. Historia getting sidelined from the story by getting pregnant off of some random farmer we never know anything about, which it's not the fact the child is not Eren's that pissed me off, but rather that she could've done so much that being someone's whore. To top it all, Eren Lelouch'd his ass out of and acts like he did something important or useful when all he did fight for something he himself committed. I always knew he was going to do that the moment he becomes evil for the greater good but never wanted to believe it as I knew it wouldn't work with the story itself.</p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">All the trouble Eren went through, all the people he's killed, it was only for his friends to live happily. Instead of removing the titan course and kill everyone that would bring peace even after his inevitable demise, he goes with the most bullshit route and makes peace for just a few generations... slightly for his friends to live their bullshit life so their descendants can get killed in the future. There is no point in taking that many lives when nothing will change that at some point in the future the entire world will unite to tear down Paradise. The latter gets obliterated, nothing was saved, and Eren is fucking stupid. Even ignoring all that, it's still rushed. The entire arc moves at an incredible pace, nothing ties back together, all the themes we so loved and praised get lost---it's as if it was completely another story. Yams was trying to give all remaining characters the task of doing something during Rumbling Arc but why? Since in the end, everyone became friends and everyone had a common goal, why make it difficult to defeat Eren by going and/or partaking in different goals? It looks like Yams wanted to give the characters more depth but clearly couldn't work with how they were presented in the first place. Either you give depth and common sense right from the start or you just don't. You can't expect me to take care of them after everything they've done and others forgive them with no actual grounds to it. </p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">If you want more proof that Armin is the most hateful character, here you go. Eren is the worst character, but Armin is a more hateful character. He is someone you would hate the moment he opens his mouth. When Armin mastered the talk-no-Jutsu it was as clear as the sun that he was going to succeed in convincing all of the previous enemies into joining his side to take down Eren, which he does, and that he had a plan into making Eren stop but think about it, why would Eren stop and how would Armin make that happen? Apparently, Armin never thought about the consequences, and the whole reason why Armin was doing all that in the first place was that he was against genocide, that there had to be a better option to put an end to this and in the last chapter he goes "Thank you for killing all them fuckers". Are you fucking kidding me?</p> 
                    <p class="text-center mb-sm-4">
                        People say shippers would never like anything if their ships don't sail. That's entirely false and you know it! It's not about the ships, it's about making sense of a ship and it doesn't have to always be the obvious, either. You have to make it clear if; 1. You want those two to end up together - 2. Add justifiable reasons why you want those two to end up together. Eren never loved Mikasa romantically. At no time in the story has he shown such emotions towards her yet in the last chapter Eren breaks down and confesses that he in fact in love with Mikasa. Where did this come from and why in the last chapter? Looking at the story and their "moments" I was never given the impression about his "love". Eren's obsession with exterminating the titans and Mikasa's obsession with Eren but not romantically doesn't make sense for both of them to have this "love" that Yams think they do. What worsens the situation is the fact Mikasa ends up with the Horse. Now, what's the fucking purpose of getting Eren to confess his feelings to Mikasa if you're making her suck Jean's dick? I can't see the merit of it at all. The same could be said with Annie and her "love" for Armin. Why is that thing? Are they forgiving for what she did earlier in the story? That easily? It never gets mentioned, neither by Hange nor by Levi. The entire Levi's squad got killed by her and he's going to let that slide? To top it all, Historia and Farmer-Kun bullshit is perhaps the worst part when it comes to "shipping". Why that exist? Why a fucking background character banged perhaps the most important character in the entire story? What's Historia's end goal? Where her story went?</p>
